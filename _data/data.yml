  title: Career Profile
  summary: >
    I began my career as an assistant sysadmin at Herzena University in Saint
    Petersburg, solving various hardware and software

    issues. Later, I worked as a project manager at a moderately large telecom
    corporation in Moscow. My first coding job was with 

    an all-in-one shop developing web and mobile apps for international clients.
    Over the last 11 years, I've worked as a front-end and 

    back-end developer, eventually transitioning to cloud architecture,
    primarily using AWS with some experience in Azure

        focus on applying mathematics to solve problems in both fields. 

        My coursework emphasized information flow management, system
        integration, and the practical application of advanced techniques in
        computer 

        science and economics. Some of the subjects I found most engaging were 
         - **Statistics & Optimization Methods**:  Techniques for analyzing data
        and improving system performance. 
         - **Econometrics**:  Applying
        statistical methods to economic data for predictive modeling and
        decision-making. 
         - **Search Systems**:  Designing and optimizing search
        algorithms and engines for efficient information retrieval.
